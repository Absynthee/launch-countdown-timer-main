## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about svgs, using the `<svg>` tag instead of wrapping it in an `<img>`. More importantly I learned about how to create a timer using Javascript and output the results into the specified fields.

I was unable to do the bonus objective of animating the card. The only ways I could find to do this were to import a jquery file and use their code, but I didn't find one that allowed me enough control over the css to keep the style the same as the design.

### Continued development

Complete the **bonus** objective of making the card flip every interval.
